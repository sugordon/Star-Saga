# Star-Saga
HackCooper 2015

The year is 2080. Earth has long since been exhausted of her natural resources, and humans, through the power of highly advanced spacecraft, have scattered to the far corners of the galaxy. Wandering bands of vagrants drift through space, fighting for valuable resources in this vast expanse of nothingness.

You, the captain of a motley fleet of space cowboys, have set up base in a remote sector of the Copper Onion galaxy, conquering your neighbors with the help of a secret cloaking technology.

One day, a mysterious adversary appears, using that very same cloaking technology to attack your fleet. Armed with only your knowledge of the battlefield, and several very large guns, defeat this new enemy!

STAR SAGA is an online multiplayer game inspired by the classic board game Battleship. Position your fleet, and launch attacks in real time at the cloaked enemy. Destroy all of your adversary's starships in order to earn victory!
